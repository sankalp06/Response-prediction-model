# Response-prediction-model
Response prediction model for marketing campaign along with GUI using stremlit
Introduction: A response model can provide a significant boost to the efficiency of a marketing campaign by increasing responses or reducing expenses. The objective is to predict who will respond to an offer for a product or service.
Methodology: In order to predict the marketing campaign response we trained the given data using a support vector machine classifier algorithm from the sci-kit-learn library.
Dependencies: Scikit-learn, Stremlit, Python
Results: The model achieved 90.4% confidence in predicting the response. we created an interactive user interface using streamlit which enable us to perform prediction in real-time. 
Conclusion: we created an interactive user interface using streamlit which enable us to perform prediction in real-time with 90.4% Confidence.
